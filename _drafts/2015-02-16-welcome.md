We love technology at Intent HQ, it drives everything that we do. We are passionate about research and building quality products using a range of systems. Over the years we have been big consumers of blogs and open source technologies and thought it was about time to start sharing some of the things we do with the wider community.

Over the coming weeks and months we plan to post on different subjects, most of them related to development, technologies and machine learning, although we will also try to post some more relaxed and humorous articles. After all, this blog will be a reflection of what happens inside Intent HQ and we spend most of the time enjoying what we do. Below are some of the subjects we plan to cover in the coming blog series:
